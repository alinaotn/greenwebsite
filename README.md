## Green Website

This "green" website informs developers and users about the sustainable use and creation of a website. This website is part of my master's thesis, which I did together with the Düsseldorf University of Applied Sciences [Hochschule Düsseldorf](https://hs-duesseldorf.de/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
